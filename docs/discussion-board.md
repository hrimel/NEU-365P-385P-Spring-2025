# Discussion board
See **Canvas** for a link to the discussion board.

## Extra Credit
You will receive **EXTRA CREDIT for participating** in the course discussion board. Each post that we deem appropriate (I realize this is subjective) will be worth `1 pt` of extra credit up to a max of `2 pts` per week. For example, *asking or answering a question* are both worth `1 pt` each. You can also receive `1 pt` for posting a *link to a relevant resource*, but you need to describe the relevance in your post.

## Rules of Participation
- Your identifier **MUST BE YOUR NAME** if you want to receive extra credit for your participation.
- Be ***respectful and inclusive***.
- Do NOT be afraid to ***ask questions***.
- You may post code snippets that help to illustrate or answer a question, but *do NOT post complete answers to the homework*.
