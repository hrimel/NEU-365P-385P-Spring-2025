# Programming rules of thumb
*Being good at programming is NOT simply knowing a lot of program syntax.*

It is about:

- Understanding a problem conceptually and being able to translate it into code.
- Thinking of new ways to tackle a problem and knowing what tools to use.
- Knowing how to fix your program when it does not work.
- Writing a program that is fast enough, not the fastest possible.
- Writing a program that can be understood by other people (or by yourself in a year!)
